I wanted to learn PHP so I created this app using the very good tutorial from https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/918836-concevez-votre-site-web-avec-php-et-mysql/.
Once I got the main idea of how it works I used it for a mapping project, which just began and I hope will go further. (as a memo, as I know no one reads this) For now I'm stuck at updating/saving updates
